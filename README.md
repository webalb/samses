## **Core Features**  

### **1. Centralized State Database**  
- Unified management of schools, students, teachers, and academic operations across the state.  
- A single source of truth for education data, fostering transparency and accountability.  

### **2. Flows Algorithm**  
- A groundbreaking algorithm for **Student Lifecycle Tracking (SLT)**.  
- Digitally generates certificates like FSLC (First School Leaving Certificate), stamping academic progress with **real-time timestamps** for every term/session.  
- Ensures tamper-proof record management and prevents unauthorized certificate creation.  

### **3. Student Collaboration Platform**  
- A state-wide portal for students to connect, share knowledge, and participate in discussions.  
- Encourages peer-to-peer learning and fosters a community of future leaders.  

### **4. Teacher and Educator Network**  
- Provides a platform for teachers to collaborate, exchange teaching resources, and share innovative ideas.  
- Enhances professional development opportunities and fosters a supportive teaching community.  

### **5. Robust Academic and Administrative Management**  
- Academic session planning with automatic handling of closures (e.g., public holidays, emergencies).  
- Detailed subject and curriculum management, including vocational and mainstream education.  
- Customizable grading systems aligned with state standards.  

### **6. Financial Transparency**  
- Centralized invoicing and fee management with optional fee selection for parents.  
- Advanced expense tracking for better budget allocation and reporting.

## **Student Lifecycle Tracking (SLT) Document**  

The **SLT Document** is a digital record created and updated by the **Flows Algorithm**.  
### It Includes:  
- Comprehensive academic history, including term-by-term performance.  
- Records of inter/intra-school transfers with real-time validation.  
- Integrated health and behavior records for a holistic student profile.
